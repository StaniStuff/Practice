## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbot a bit better way. Before this task I was used to used grid for everything, but this time I deep dived into flex

### Continued development

I would I like to use grid, and flexbox together more, and create even more responsive basic sites with them.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox CSS In 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc&t) - An amazing video which showed me the basic concepts of Flex.
